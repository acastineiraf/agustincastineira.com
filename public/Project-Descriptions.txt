While working in THE O team we looked for consistency for all the different public faces of the company. Minimalistic design, fashion look, a carefree lifestyle and wearable tech were some of the basic concepts we worked around to generate the brand identity through all of our product components: Web, App, Product and Packaging.

Remote employ takes away a lot of the daily interaction you need to iterate quickly so we were constantly meeting trough Skype and brainstorming to curate my designs.

The process we normally followed was:
<ul>
	<li>Brief definition of the requirements. Nothing too deep. </li>
	<li>Normally I took one first quick iteration to get a couple or three ideas to put on the table. Sometimes there was some investigation in this step too.</li>
	<li>Then we started with the iterations of feedback + discussion + conclusion + next steps + repeat. </li>
	<li>Prepare the final deliverables.</li>
</ul>
We tried as hard as we could to define deadlines to stop the iterations process soon enough and prepare the final deliverables on time and finally we managed to get the product on the market!
