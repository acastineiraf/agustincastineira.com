    <p style="margin-top:15px;">THE O is an app that works combined with THE O device. It connects the device with the phone and aso checks if the device is with you or if you forgot/lost it. In that case the app alets you.</p>
    <p>I worked together with the development team to create an interface that shows in a simple way all the different states of the devices: Lost, save, with you... as well as display crearly what device is attached to each of your belongings.</p>
    <p>After months of development and countless iterations the app is available in both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.</p>
