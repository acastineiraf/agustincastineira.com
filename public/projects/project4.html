    <p style="margin-top:15px;">This is a personal side project I worked on for a couple of weeks. The idea is simple, each dot means a different week, from your birth to your 80's. And the colours means the following:</p>
    <p><svg height="10" width="10"> <circle cx="5" cy="5" r="5" stroke-width="0" fill="#fc6938"/></svg> birthday week  |
    <svg height="10" width="10"> <circle cx="5" cy="5" r="5" stroke-width="0" fill="#242933"/></svg> week you already lived |
    <svg height="10" width="10"> <circle cx="5" cy="5" r="5" stroke-width="0" fill="#bdbfc2"/></svg> week of the future </p>
    <p>The main idea I want you to get from this poster is to live life, be espontaneous and enjoy the moment. Decide what to do each week of your life, because time goes by!</p>
    <p>You can get your own for free <a href="https://agustincastineira.com/calendar.html"> HERE!</a></p>
