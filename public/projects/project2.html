      <p style="margin-top:15px;">This is a side project I created to have fun, practice some coding and to explore the concept of web apps. I wanted to experiment the complete process of attracting traffic, setting experiments, getting conclusions and making iterations based on them.</p>
      <p>I meet weekly with a Back End expert who is collaborating with me. It helps me to understand all the front-back connections and management.</p>
      <p>What is it about? Do something ptoductive while you are seated on the toilet: manage a task list, take a 5 minutes lesson, or push your project one step forward! </p>
      <p>I am still working on this so you can visit the development site <a href="https://the-focused-toilet.firebaseapp.com/">here</a>, but remember the site is only for mobile.</p>
