    <p style="margin-top:15px;">Working in THE O team I focused on consistency for all the different public faces of the company. Minimalistic design, fashion look, a carefree lifestyle and wearable tech were some of the basic concepts we worked around to generate the brand identity through all of our product components: Web, App, Product and Packaging.</p>
    <p>The process we normally followed was:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Brief definition of the requirements.</li>
      <li>First quick iteration to get a couple or three ideas to put on the table.</li>
      <li>Iterations of feedback + discussion + conclusion + next steps + repeat.</li>
      <li>Final deliverables.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We defined deadlines to stop the iterations process soon enough to prepare the final deliverables on time and finally we managed to get the product on the market!</p>
