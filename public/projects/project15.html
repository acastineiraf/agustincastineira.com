    <p style="margin-top:15px;">I work as Graphic Designer in a project basis with a US Marketing Agency where I design and manage Kickstarter campaigns.</p>
    <p>My main goal is to design the campaign and curate the assets the client provide to get the better possible output. It is a job I enjoy a lot because it is different every time.</p>
    <p>After a couple of iterations (sometimes a lot more) I prepare the cmapaign in the Kickstarter or Indiegogo website so we can send it to get approved, launch and rise the funding!</p>
