    <p style="margin-top:15px;"> My personal website have been one of my main learning/training tools. I have remade it countless times and each of them I raised the level to get: first good disposition of the information (years ago), then good looking design, then functional design as well, and lately I am working on UX concepts and SEO.</p>
    <p>I also use Google Analytics and Hotjar to make decisions based on data and I love it! Read more about how and what I do it in the UX project of my website in the "WORK" section.</p>
    <p>One cool and curious detail I worked on for the previous version was a video that pops after some time of inactivity in which I appeard myself pointing to the contact me button. It was a really fun feature to develop!</p>
