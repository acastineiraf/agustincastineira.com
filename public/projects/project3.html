    <p style="margin-top:15px;">This startup based in Nigeria contacted me to create a responsive website app based on a spreadsheet. The idea was to provide the potential customers with a precise estimation of the prices they would pay depending on multiple variables.</p>
    <p>The challange here was to build a front end connected with a Google Sheet where the variables could be changed and adjusted to deliver updated prices.</p>
    <p>I used Google Apps Scipts to generate the interaction between the Front-End and the Back-End Spreadsheet.</p>
