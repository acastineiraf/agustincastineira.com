    <p style="margin-top:15px;"> Sometimes I participate in Design Contests. This one was a Web Design contest were the main focus was simplicuty and clear design.</p>
    <p>I started with simple mockups getting inspired from the whatsapp website or some mobile apps' corporative websites and then I iterated on that design to create 3 different options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hipster/millennial target group</li>
      <li>Young/fancy target group</li>
      <li>Minimal design target group</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The final resilt is simple yet very attractive for each of the considered target users.</p>
