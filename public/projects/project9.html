    <p style="margin-top:15px;">This project was a challange for me since it was made for mobile users first and I had to take into account the balance between usability, simplicity and good look.</p>
    <p>For me it was really interesting to make small animations in the homa page, use a background video and a collapsed form to contact the company.</p>
    <p>It was also fun to play around with the forms the user needs to fill in various steps and the final disposition of the final prices that depends on what results the user gets from his parameters.</p>
