    <p style="margin-top:15px;">This project started as a contest. I participated, won and then I developed the complete interface. I iterated on the design based on the Alpha version of the app and how the new users were interacting.</p>
    <p>Ideally I would have ran some interviews and/or experiments to get better conclusions. Even so I got prenty of good words from the development team about the final result.</p>
    <p>The design is simple and straight to the point. They were looking for an intuitive solution that solved the function.</p>
