    <p style="margin-top:15px;">Some time ago I started to use heatmaps and user recording services as a complement for Google Analytics. Then I started to apply it to my personal website and I got some clear conclusions.</p>
    <p>The first one was that the people comming to my site wanted to see my projects and were not that interested in my profile. So I switched positions.</p>
    <p>I keep doing analysis on every visitor and try to deliver better the message I want to transmit.</p>
